### Some useful linux commands to understand the shell scripts in better aspect

* Limit the number of characters to be entered by the user
```bash
read -n1 -p "Do you wish to continue (y/N) ?"
```

* Shell provides an option to hide text when the user enters any sensitive information
```bash
read -s -p "What's your passcode ?" passcode
```

* To check the passcode later
```shell
echo $passcode
```

* Check if a particular directory exists or not using a full command
```bash
test -d $HOME
echo $?
```

* Or we can achieve the same using a short hand notation
```bash
[ -d $HOME ]
echo $?
```

* This is known as Extended short hand, basically this command is used if there's any extra spaces between the commands
```bash
[[ -d $HOME ]]
echo $?
```

* Some more examples of `test` command
```bash
test 9 -gt 5 && echo "True" || echo "False"
```

* '-gt' stands for greater than

* Which can be further explained and executed seperately in cli as well

```bash
test 9 -gt 5            # this command will satisfy this statement ( && ) i.e., "True"
echo $?
```

```bash
test 9 -gt 29           # this command will satisfy this statement ( || ) i.e., "False"
echo $?
```

* The test command returns an exit status which is used by shell to determine whether the condition was true or false. In the above cases, if `echo $?` returns the output as '0' means true/success and if the output as '1' then it's false/failure

* However, we can interchange the 'True/False' positions according to our requirements

* Short hand version

```bash
[ 9 -gt 5 ] && echo "True" || echo "False"
```

```bash
[ 9 -gt 29 ] && echo "True" || echo "False"
```

* Same can be achieved for checking if a file exists or not
```bash
test -f ./sample.txt
echo $?
```

* OR a short hand notation
```bash
[ -f ./sample.txt ]
echo $?
```

* Extended short hand example
```bash
[[ -f ./sample.txt ]]
echo $?
```

* Some more examples of `test` command
* This will return 0 if the script is found, otherwise it returns 1
```bash
test -f ./scripts/script1.sh 
echo $?
```

* Instead of using `echo $?` all the time manually, we can use ```&& echo "True" || echo "False"```

```bash
[ -f ./scripts/script2.sh ] && echo "File exists" || echo "File doesnot exists"
```

* OR

```bash
[ -f ./scripts/script1.sh ] && echo "File Found" || echo "File not Found"
```

_NOTES:_

1. Use `:` instead of `/bin/bash` for simple scripting. It is more portable as it doesnâ€™t require bash to be present
2. We can use the output of one command as an input to another command by using backticks ``
3. We can use `-z` to check if string is empty, `-n` to check if string is non-empty
4. `[[]]` is used for arithmetic comparison and also for testing conditions in scripts</s>
5. We can also perform string comparison, file existence checks etc with test command
6. The exit status of any command (including test) is stored in `$?`. If the last executed command was successful then it's value
